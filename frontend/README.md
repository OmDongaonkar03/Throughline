# Throughline – Frontend

The frontend for Throughline - a memory layer for what you’re building and thinking.

Throughline helps people log small, messy daily check-ins about their work, ideas, and progress. Over time, those fragments are remembered, connected, and turned into coherent stories in the user’s own voice.

This app is the surface of that experience.

The frontend is designed to feel calm, human, and non-performative.
Users shouldn’t feel pressure to “write well” — only to log honestly.
