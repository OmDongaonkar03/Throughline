# Throughline

Throughline is a personal progress system that turns daily work into long-term clarity.

Most work disappears into memory. Throughline treats daily activity as data — something that can be remembered, synthesized, and reasoned over time. You write a short daily check-in, and the system generates weekly and monthly narratives that make real progress visible.

This is not a habit tracker or a journaling app.  
It’s an evolving memory layer for your work.

---

## What it does

- Capture lightweight daily check-ins  
- Synthesize them into weekly and monthly summaries  
- Build a living timeline of your work  
- Reduce cognitive load — write once, let the system remember  
- Stay private by default (local-first LLMs)

---

## Design principles

- **Local-first** – personal data stays with you  
- **LLM-agnostic** – swap models without rewrites  
- **Time-oriented** – structured around days, weeks, months  
- **Systems over features** – built to compound over time

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React  
- Backend: Node.js (Express)  
- Database: MySQL  
- AI Orchestration: Mastra (TypeScript)  
- LLM: Local models via Ollama (cloud providers as drop-in later)

## Status

This project is actively being built in public as part of a  
**12 Projects in 12 Months** series.

The goal is not a demo.  
It’s a long-running system that can still make sense months from now.

Expect:
- Breaking changes  
- Iteration in the open  
- Architecture evolving with real constraints

## Vision

Throughline exists for builders who do a lot of work and rarely get a clear picture of how it compounds.

It’s for people who care less about streaks and more about meaning over time.
