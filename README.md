# Throughline

Throughline is a memory layer for what you’re building and thinking.

Instead of trying to write perfect posts every day, you log small, messy check-ins about your work, ideas, learnings, or struggles. Throughline remembers those fragments over time, finds patterns across days and weeks, and turns them into coherent stories in your own voice.

It’s not a journaling app.
It’s not just another AI writer.
It’s a system that treats your daily progress as data and helps it compound into narrative.

You don’t write stories here.
You live them. Throughline connects the dots.

## What it does

* Capture lightweight daily check-ins (raw, messy, unpolished)
* Remember your activity over time
* Synthesize weekly and monthly narratives
* Generate “base posts” from your real progress
* Adapt those posts for platforms like LinkedIn, X, and Reddit
* Learn your voice from samples and tone preferences
* Let you regenerate, refine, like/dislike, and evolve output
* Visualize momentum (streaks, calendar, activity)

The loop is simple:

> Log what matters → We remember → We connect → You share

## Why it’s different

Most tools generate content from a prompt.

Throughline generates content from **you over time**.

* You don’t start from a blank page
* You don’t need perfect thoughts
* You don’t have to remember everything

You just show up honestly.
Throughline handles continuity, context, and synthesis.

## Core Concepts

* **Check-ins** – Small daily notes about what you worked on, learned, or thought about.
* **Memory Layer** – Your check-ins accumulate into long-term context.
* **Base Post** – A coherent narrative generated from your real progress.
* **Platform Adapters** – Turn the base post into native-feeling content for each platform.
* **Tone System** – Learn your voice from samples and manual preferences.

## Status

Throughline is entering **private beta**.

This is a real product in motion, not a demo:

* Features will evolve
* Copy will change
* The system will learn from real use
* Architecture will harden under reality

The goal isn’t to ship something flashy.
It’s to build a system that still makes sense months from now.

---

## Vision

Throughline exists for people who are building something and want their progress to mean something over time.

It’s for:

* Builders
* Developers
* Indie hackers
* Founders
* Anyone who thinks in fragments and wants them to become a story

Not streaks.
Not vanity metrics.

Just continuity.
